- Name:
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module:
- Database Used: `sqlda` (Sample Datasets)
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin or psql)

---

## Instructions

- Use the **sqlda** database from the "Loading the Sample Datasets" instructions.
- For each SQL task:
  - Include your SQL in a fenced code block
  - Execute it and include a **screenshot** showing the query and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.
- For explanation questions:
  - Write your answer in complete sentences
  - Include a screenshot if requested

## Question 1

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed
to show a **list of years** that emails were sent.

Your results should list years like this (order matters):

```text
year
2011
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 2

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to
show the **number of messages sent by year**,
ordered by year (as shown in the prompt).

Output should resemble:

```text
count    year
-----    ----
...      2011
...      2013
...      2014
...      2015
...      2016
...      2017
...      2018
...      2019
...
### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date)
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 3

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show:

- the **sent date**
- the **opened date**
- the **interval** between the two

Only include emails that contain **both** a sent date and an opened date.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    sent_date,
    opened_date,
    opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
  AND opened_date IS NOT NULL;
```

## Question 4

Using the `sqlda` database,
write the SQL needed to
show emails that contain an **opened date BEFORE the sent date**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    sent_date,
    opened_date
FROM emails
WHERE opened_date < sent_date;
```

### Screenshot

## Question 5

Using the `sqlda` database:
there are **over 100 emails**
that contain an opened date **BEFORE** the sent date.

After looking at the data, **why is this the case?**

### Answer
Having carefully examined the data provided in question #4, there are 109 emails found where the opened data is before the sent date. The dates are similar, but  many sent date recorded as 15:00:00 while the opened_date showed an earlier time. This suggests there is an issue with how the timestamps were recorded in the dataset.

## Question 6

Using the `sqlda` database, explain in your own words what the following code does:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_points AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM customers
    WHERE longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND latitude IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE dealership_points AS (
    SELECT
        dealership_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM dealerships
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_dealership_distance AS (
    SELECT
       customer_id,
       dealership_id,
       c.lng_lat_point <@> d.lng_lat_point AS distance
    FROM customer_points c
    CROSS JOIN dealership_points d
);
```

### Answer
Customer Locations: The first table captures each customer's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) while filtering out records with missing location data.Dealership Locations: The second table stores the coordinates for every dealership.Distance Mapping: The final table pairs every customer with every dealership using a CROSS JOIN. It then calculates the physical distance between them to output a matrix showing the customer ID, dealership ID, and their calculated distance.

## Question 7

Using the `sqlda` database,
write SQL to display an
**array of salespeople for each dealership**,
sorted by dealership.

For example - dealership 1 is below:

```text
"{""Fidell,Granville"",""Onele,Jereme"",""Sheriff,Lelia"",""McSpirron,Massimiliano"",""Rennick,Nadia"",""Mace,Eveleen"",""Oxteby,Dukie"",""Spong,Marcos"",""Wogden,Quent"",""Duny,Sandye"",""Loraine,Englebert"",""Meere,Ira"",""Gibbens,Cristine"",""Prine,Lyda"",""McCoughan,Sheff"",""Schule,Giselbert"",""McAndie,Eleen"",""Dosedale,Dorie"",""Nafziger,Shay""}"
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    dealership_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(last_name || ',' || first_name) AS salespeople
FROM salespeople
GROUP BY dealership_id
ORDER BY dealership_id;
```

## Question 8

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state** of the dealership
- the **number of salespeople** for the dealership

Sort by **state**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    s.dealership_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name) AS salespeople,
    d.state,
    COUNT(*) AS salesperson_count
FROM salespeople AS s
JOIN dealerships AS d
    ON s.dealership_id = d.dealership_id
GROUP BY
    s.dealership_id,
    d.state
ORDER BY
    d.state;
```

## Question 9

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to convert
the **customers** table to **JSON**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    row_to_json(customers)
FROM customers;
```

### Screenshot

## Question 10

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state**
- the **number of salespeople**
- sorted by **state**

Then **convert this result to JSON**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray-1](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray-1.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT row_to_json(dealership_data)
FROM (
    SELECT
        s.dealership_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name) AS salespeople,
        d.state,
        COUNT(*) AS salesperson_count
    FROM salespeople AS s
    JOIN dealerships AS d
        ON s.dealership_id = d.dealership_id
    GROUP BY
        s.dealership_id,
        d.state
    ORDER BY
        d.state
) AS dealership_data;
```
